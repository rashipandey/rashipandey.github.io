I developed a comprehensive social media application that emulates key features of popular platforms like Facebook. The app includes user registration, profile customization with image uploads, and a post-sharing system. A notable feature is the implementation of a responsive day/night mode for improved user experience.

The application leverages modern web technologies, primarily React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. This tech stack ensures a robust and efficient architecture, facilitating smooth functionality across various devices and platforms.

The development process involved integrating multiple components to create a cohesive and user-friendly interface. The result is a responsive and intuitive application that performs well on both mobile and desktop environments.
