The Analysis of Algorithms (COT5405) project involved developing various algorithms to maximize stock trading profits based on price predictions over multiple days. It addressed problems like single transactions, multiple transactions with cooldown periods, and limited transactions. Implementations included a brute force method, a greedy algorithm, and dynamic programming solutions. The project overcame challenges related to efficiency, correctness, and handling large datasets. Detailed design, pseudocode, correctness proofs, and experimental comparisons highlight the performance and effectiveness of each algorithm.
