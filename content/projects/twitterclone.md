I built a mini-Twitter that's like the real deal, but with my own geeky twist. Imagine Twitter, but running on a super-cool language called Erlang â€“ it's like the secret sauce that makes everything run smoothly behind the scenes.

On the surface, it looks and feels just like Twitter. You can tweet your heart out, follow your friends (or celebrities, no judgment!), retweet the good stuff, and even dive into hashtag rabbit holes. But here's where it gets fun: I made it so that everything happens lightning-fast. When you tweet, it's like your words are teleporting to your followers' feeds instantly.

Building this was like creating a digital playground where bits of information zip around at the speed of light. It was a blast to put together, and it really made me appreciate the brains behind the real Twitter.
