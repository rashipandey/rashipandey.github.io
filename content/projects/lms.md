I built this cool online classroom that's like Udemy, but with my own twist. It's got a smart search that helps you find courses super fast, and you can pay safely without any fuss. Teachers can easily upload their lessons, including videos, and students get to track their progress in real-time. The best part? When you finish a course, you get this fun little celebration animation â€“ it's the digital equivalent of a high five! It was a blast putting all these techy pieces together to create something that makes learning a bit more fun and a lot more accessible.
