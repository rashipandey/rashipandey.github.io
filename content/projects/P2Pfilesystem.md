The P2P File Sharing System is a project developed for the CNT5106C - Computer Networks course, enabling decentralized file sharing among peers within a network. The system allows peers to share, request, and download file pieces, ensuring efficient data transfer and file reconstruction. Key features include TCP handshake for connection establishment, message handling for various peer interactions, and scheduling algorithms for optimal data exchange. The project is implemented in Java, utilizing multi-threading for concurrency, and is designed for deployment on CISE machines. Contributions from team members ensured robust protocol implementation, efficient file management, and comprehensive logging for monitoring the system.
